# Standford's Machine Learning Course from Coursera

I made this repository to organize and improve the codes that I complete during the Machine Learning course offer by Stanford through Coursera. I encourage you to don't observe the codes if you are doing the course because You will learn more if you find the errors by yourself. 

# Getting started 

For the moment I will only upload the code and do a brief describtion of in each folder of the principal code made that week. I would summary the principal idea of each week code as follows: 

## Week1 
Linear regression with one variable and severa variables using gradient descent and normal equation methods. 

## Week2
Regularized Logisitc Regression with polynomial features as input. 

## Week3
Muticlassification and a first aproximation algorithm for a neural network.

## Week4
Week4: Neuronal Networks Learning: a better algorith for Neural Networks.
